          <br>
          I graduated from <strong>Benson Polytechnic High School</strong> in 2014. I spent my first year out of highschool working, quickly disillusioned by my minimal experience I tried out conventional education at Portland Community College.
          This venture too was relatively short lived as I found myself spending more money than I was comfortable with to attend classes that could not hold my interest or make me feel any inclination towards some sort of career.
          After reentering the work force for another year and a half, I was demoralized by the prospect of soulless manual labor and decided that I needed to find a skill that was both marketable <strong>and</strong> fun!
          Fortunately an old friend of mine worked as a web dev for a health care company and was kind enough to give me a view into his work life as a developer. This sparked a sort of obsession. I quickly made plans to quit my job
          and started doing independent research. Finally I discovered <strong><em>Epicodus</em></strong>. I attended the soonest workshop I could and enrolled shortly thereafter.
          <br>
          <br>
          Though my current fascination is with code, my first and likely lifelong love is music. I've spent the greater part of my teenage and young adult years playing, practicing, recording and mixing music.
          I primarily play heavy metal but am a fan of all sorts of music and have branched out to playing other genres recently. I hope to reach a point where I can use my coding skills to more effectively market myself as a
          sound engineer as well as work full time as a web developer.
