        <img class="img-responsive" src="img/jam.jpg" alt="image of Omnifood-site">
        <p class="about">I graduated from Benson Polytechnic High School in 2014. I spent my first year out of highschool working, quickly disillusioned by my minimal experience I tried out conventional education at Portland Community College.
           This venture too was relatively short lived as I found myself spending more money than I was comfortable with to attend classes that could not hold my interest or make me feel any inclination towards some sort of career.
